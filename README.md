## 1. Architecture Overview

The continuous training and deployment pipeline for our transformer-based text classification model consists of the following components:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Training
3. Model Evaluation
4. Performance Monitoring
5. Retraining Trigger
6. Model Deployment
7. Inference (Live and Batch)

## 2. Monitoring Model Staleness

We will monitor model staleness using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy: We'll continuously evaluate the model's accuracy on a validation set.
2. Data Drift: We'll monitor the distribution of input features to detect significant changes in the data distribution.

Thresholds:
- Accuracy: If the model's accuracy drops below 80% on the validation set, we'll trigger retraining.
- Data Drift: We'll use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to detect significant changes in the data distribution. If the p-value is below 0.05, we'll trigger retraining.

## 3. Infrastructure for Deployment

For this implementation, we'll use a local deployment setup. However, the architecture can be easily adapted to cloud environments like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

Components:
1. Local Python environment for training and evaluation
2. MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning
3. Flask for serving the model API
4. Docker for containerization (optional, for easier deployment)

## 4. Inference Methods

### Live Inference
- We'll use Flask to create an API endpoint for real-time predictions.
- The API will accept JSON input containing the text to be classified.
- The model will be loaded into memory for quick inference.

### Batch Inference
- We'll implement a separate script for batch processing of large datasets.
- The script will read input data from a CSV file, process it in batches, and write predictions to an output file.

## 5. Cost Optimizations

1. Model Compression: We'll use DistilBERT instead of full BERT for a smaller model size and faster inference.
2. Batch Processing: For large-scale inference, we'll use batch processing to optimize throughput.
3. Caching: Implement caching for frequent requests to reduce computation.
4. Scheduled Retraining: Instead of continuous retraining, we'll schedule retraining checks at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly).
5. Resource Allocation: In a cloud environment, we'd use auto-scaling to adjust resources based on demand.

## 6. Retraining Strategy

1. Monitor model performance continuously using MLflow.
2. If performance drops below the threshold or data drift is detected, trigger the retraining process.
3. Retrain the model on the updated dataset.
4. Evaluate the new model on a holdout test set.
5. If the new model performs better, deploy it to replace the current model.
6. Send email notifications to administrators about the retraining process and its results.
